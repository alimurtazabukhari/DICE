1. This Java program simulates a single-player version of the Craps dice game.
2. The user presses Enter to roll two dice, and the program prints their sum.
3. If the sum is 7 or 11, the player wins; if it's 2, 3, or 12, the player loses.
4. For other sums, a "point" is set and the player continues rolling until they match the point (win) or roll a 7 (lose).
5. The game uses only standard input, random number generation, and basic control flow for gameplay.
